# sample_app
 Bloc template app with some features.
 
 It starts from this example on BloC docs : https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterlogintutorial
 
 Then I added new things like :
  -  User remains authenticated until log out (even when app is closed).
  - Added BloC that handles internet connection status.
  
  Now I'm working on adding a "Camera BloC" that handles features like shoot photos, videos...
 
 Feel free to use this project as you like, I'm always looking for suggestions or collaborators.
